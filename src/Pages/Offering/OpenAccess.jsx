          <p className="intro">
            Solar Open Access (SOA) is an innovative model that allows
            commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers to generate electricity
            from solar power plants located away from their premises. This
            approach enables businesses to harness clean energy at a competitive
            rate, leading to reduced energy costs and a significant reduction in
            carbon footprints.
          </p>
          <p className="details">
            The SOA model opens up opportunities for large-scale solar power
            generation without the need for on-site installations. It provides
            flexibility in terms of power purchase agreements (PPAs) and allows
            businesses to benefit from renewable energy without heavy capital
            expenditure. Solar Open Access is also a step towards achieving
            sustainability goals while contributing to India's green energy
            mission.

          <h2 className="sub-heading">How Solar Open Access Works?</h2>
          <p className="process-description">
          Solar Open Access allows consumers to source renewable power directly from nearby solar plants via the grid. A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is established with the solar developer, outlining tariffs and supply terms. The generated solar energy is transmitted through the distribution network, ensuring reliable delivery. Consumers pay open access charges for using the grid infrastructure. Surplus power can be banked or net-metered based on local regulations. This system reduces dependence on fossil fuels, lowers electricity costs, and provides energy security. Itâ€™s an eco-friendly option for businesses aiming to cut emissions and ensure stable energy supply.
